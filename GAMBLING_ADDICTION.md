## You are missing all the fun if you push your luck too far!

Gambling is a form of entertainment, but it can become a problem if you lose control.

Problem gambling occurs when the player starts allocating more and more money to this activity and spending more and more time in the gambling hall. What was originally considered a pleasant way to spend time, is beginning to become an obsessive activity that takes over all thoughts, to the detriment of real-life concerns.
